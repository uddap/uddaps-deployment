# Tuple is type of DS, where we can store different values, now if you're familiar with lists in python.Tuple is actually
# very similar to a list. Basically a structure where we can store multiple pieces of information but a tuple has a few key
# differences from lists that we are going to talk about in this tutorial first thing I want to do is I want to show you though
# how to create a tuple,so I can come down here and I can create a tuple and one of the most common examples of toupels is coordinates.
# so let's say I had a series of like x,y coordinates I could create a variable. once you create a tuple, mutable cant modify or change
# or erase or add elements inside the tuple.what you see is what you get once you create the tuple its

coordinates=(4, 5)
coordinates[1] = 10
#plenty of situations where you want to use tuples so if you're in a situation where you want to store data that can't be changed or mutated.
# Then the tuples are the way to go. So tuple is a great thing to add in c or python repertoire

print(coordinates[1])
# function is basically a collection of code, which performs a specific task.
